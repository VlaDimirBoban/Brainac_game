# Brainiac video game

First video game I made using raylib. Fun times.

Raylib is a great starting point to get a firm grasp on basic game dev concepts. Afterwards you can easily write your own 2D library from scratch.
There are a few other options SFML and SDL2, both are fine.
 
All assets included.

Raylib install download:
